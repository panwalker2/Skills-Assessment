Installation Notes
---------
- Setting this up on a personal windows machine running Windows 7, installing node.js/npm and gulp from scratch.
- Installing gulp gave severe warnings, chose to install using "npm install gulp@4.0.0". Localhost:3000 wouldn't load after following instructions.
- Researched, realized this was for a v3 gulp, uninstalled gulp 4 and installed gulp 3 ignoring severe warnings. Localhost:3000 runs fine.
- Hated trying to look at assets in Windows Photo Viewer, downloaded trial version of Photoshop CC successfully.

Initial Thoughts
---------
- Bootstrap!?
- Might use that js library I've used a bit for loading in sections as you scroll down (what's the name?), or else coding it myself.
- Images do not appear to be optimized for web.
- Trial browserstack account to test in multiple browsers? Otherwise will need to download Virtualbox or something similar and set up images so that I can test.
- 1920px is max screen resolution width here, so that should be fine.
